\section{Introduction}
In this article, we will attempt to showcase how easy it is to
produce a document in LateX which can be easily read on a phone
or any handheld device. It is not a surprising fact that most
people find it hard to read and navigate a LaTeX document when on
the phone. LaTeX defaults are designed for printed paper and when
viewed on phone, people run into these issues:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The large paper size leads to very small font size when
	the page is viewed as a whole in portrait mode.
	\item Landscape mode requires that the phone be held horizontally
	which is usually inconvenient and requires a lot of scrolling.
	\item Many a times, one has to zoom into a small part of the
	document and then move horizontally following the line. This
	makes navigation a headache.
\end{itemize}

So let's try and produce a version of the document suited for mobile
viewing perhaps? Reading ought to be easy and natural, the design of
the document should get out of the way and let us concentrate on the
content. Hence, I present to you this format. The template.xml file
included with this, will allow you to easily switch between compiling
for desktop and mobile viewers. How hard is it to just compile twice
and put out two files instead of one, if it affords the viewer a
better experience and correspondingly increases the chances your
document will be read properly?

Enough talk, let's see some math here.

\begin{align*}
	\int_{-\inf}^{+\inf} e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}} dx &= \sqrt{2\pi} \\
	e^{\pi i} + 1 &= 0
\end{align*}

Even this complicated equation I found by searching 'complicated latex
formula' on Google.

\begin{align*}
	S(\omega)
	&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} e^{[ -0.74\bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\bigr\}^{\!-4}\,]} \\
	&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} \exp\Bigl[ -0.74\Bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\Bigr\}^{\!-4}\,\Bigr] 
\end{align*}

But you might say \textit{"All this sans serif font business is making me feel
weird. I like the standard LaTeX font."}. Sure! Skip to the next page for that.
